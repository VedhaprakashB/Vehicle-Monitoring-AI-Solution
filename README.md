# Vehicle Monitoring AI Solution 🚚🔍  
**Internship at Innodatatics, Hyderabad (May – July 2024)**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an AI-powered vehicle monitoring system for warehouse logistics. The system detects and tracks vehicle number plates using real-time image feeds to ensure route compliance and streamline vehicle entry/exit monitoring.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect vehicle number plates entering and exiting the warehouse.
- Ensure route compliance of loaded/unloaded trucks.
- Automate monitoring to assist warehouse staff in real-time.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **YOLOv8** – Object detection model for localizing number plates.
- **PaddleOCR** – Optical Character Recognition for extracting text from plates.
- **Python** – Core programming language for modeling and automation.
- **OpenCV** – Image processing and webcam integration.
- **IP Webcam App** – Used to stream video from mobile devices.
- **Jupyter Notebook / Colab** – For model development and experimentation.

## 🛠️ Key Contributions
- Built an AI-based number plate recognition system with **95% precision** and **75% real-world accuracy**.
- Developed and preprocessed datasets from client-supplied images, including annotation and cleaning pipelines.
- Automated end-to-end data workflows using Python, reducing manual processing time by **30%**.
- Implemented a vehicle tracking solution to detect and flag trucks using incorrect routes, enhancing route compliance by **20%**.
- Integrated real-time video feeds from mobile/laptop webcams to display detection results to warehouse staff.
